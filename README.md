House Price prediction using Data Mining

**Database to use:** -Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) & (ZHVF) <br /> 
&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;&emsp; **Description:** Zillow Home Value Index dataset that is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type.<br />
&emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;<br />


**Technology to use:**  Linear Regression Model, <br />
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gradient Boosting Regression<br />

**Platforms:** Jupyter notebook, Python3, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, sklearn, etc. 

**Description of Project:**  The goal of the project to define a Data Mining Solution to be able to predict with some accuracy (currently 45% for linear model) the future home prices for potential investors. 
<br /> **Some Results from project implementation: **
